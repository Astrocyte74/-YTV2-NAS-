      "summary": "Finland sat next to the Soviet Union, and for decades many in Moscow assumed it would one day be absorbed. It never was. The core reason is simple: annexing Finland would have cost the Soviet Union far more than it was worth, while influence without occupation gave Moscow almost everything it wanted.\n\nFirst, let’s set the stage. Finland declared independence in 1917 as the Russian Empire collapsed. A short civil war followed, with non‑communist Whites defeating the communist Reds. By 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia fixed their border by treaty, but tension lingered. Joseph Stalin still aimed to reassert control over former imperial lands, and Finland was on that list.\n\nMoving to 1939, Stalin issued an ultimatum demanding the border move west after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany. Finland refused, and the Winter War began. The Finns fought hard and inflicted heavy Soviet losses. They could not hold forever, though, and ceded territory and paid reparations. Even so, the cost of that limited gain showed Moscow how expensive a full conquest would be.\n\nThen came 1941 and the Continuation War. Finland, seeking lost territory, joined Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union and advanced deep into Soviet lands. When Germany stalled, Finland stopped as well. By 1944, the Red Army pushed Finland back and forced peace talks. At that moment, the Soviets could have invaded and occupied the entire country. They chose not to. The most important reason was cost. Every division and shell spent in Finland was a division and shell not used against Nazi Germany, the main fight that year. There was also a strategic risk. Occupying Finland would put Soviet troops right on Sweden’s doorstep, likely pushing Stockholm into a hostile stance and, later, toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.\n\nAfter 1944, Finland paid a price but kept its state. It ceded the territories already lost, plus additional land in the north, legalized its Communist Party, and tried wartime leaders for war crimes. Relations were tense, but in 1948 the two sides signed a Friendship Treaty. Finland could remain independent and neutral, outside both NATO and the Soviet‑led Warsaw Pact, so long as it prevented any attack on the Soviet Union through its territory. Unofficially, Helsinki avoided crossing Moscow on major foreign policy issues. This posture became known as Finlandization: sovereignty preserved, but with careful self‑restraint to keep the superpower next door satisfied.\n\nIn the end, the Soviet Union never annexed Finland because it didn’t need to. Moscow secured a buffer on its northwest flank, gained territory, extracted reparations, and kept a neutral neighbor that often muted opposition to Soviet aims. Full annexation would have bled manpower and material, antagonized Sweden, and sacrificed a useful, independent voice abroad for little added security. The cost was high, the benefit marginal, and influence beat occupation.",
