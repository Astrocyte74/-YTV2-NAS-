      "summary": "Google just turned natural language into a serious app‑building shortcut. Stitch, a free tool from Google, lets you describe what you want and get a working user interface, complete with screens, styles, and exportable code, in minutes. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro in experimental mode by default, it now aims for more creative, easier‑to‑edit results, with Google reporting users preferred these outputs roughly three times more than the standard mode.\n\nFirst, let’s look at what it actually does. Type a prompt like “mobile app for couples to generate date night ideas and vote on their favorites,” and you get a full interface in under two minutes, including the ideas list, a voting flow, a confirmation step, calendar integration, and profile settings. It’s not just a picture. You get working HTML and Cascading Style Sheets code, visual design with colors, typography, spacing, and component layouts, and a one‑click export to Figma for deeper edits. There’s also image‑to‑UI: snap a photo of a whiteboard sketch or upload a screenshot you like, and Stitch recreates it as a functional design you can tweak. The new Canvas view lets you see the entire user flow at once, track component state, and keep design consistency across screens, which is especially helpful for multi‑page apps.\n\nMoving on to scope, this isn’t limited to mobile apps. It can spin up websites, landing pages, admin dashboards, booking systems, and e‑commerce layouts—essentially any interface with screens and components. A detailed brief gets you richer results. For example, a recipe discovery platform can be directed to use warm, appetizing colors like terracotta and sage, include a hero carousel with high‑quality photography, and build an explorer with filters for cuisine, dietary needs, cooking time sliders, and difficulty. Results arrive fast, and you can compare multiple versions before exporting.\n\nWhen it comes to access and pricing, it’s straightforward. Go to stitch.withgoogle.com, sign in with your Google account, and you’re in—no downloads, no setup, and no credit card. Stitch first appeared at Google I/O in May 2025 and has since switched to Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental mode by default. That shift is meant to deliver more creative, edit‑friendly outputs without you needing to toggle models.\n\nFor real‑world uses, the immediate value is speed and client confidence. Agencies can generate first‑pass designs and then customize them in Figma, often cutting early design time dramatically. Freelancers can sell rapid prototyping, turning a client idea into a clickable concept the same day. Development teams can walk into a first meeting with screens and flows ready, which makes scoping and buy‑in easier. Because the exported code is clean and organized, it can serve as a starting point for engineers rather than a throwaway mockup.\n\nHowever, there’s an important trade‑off. The Canvas feature is new and may feel a bit rough as it rolls out. Designs, while clean and functional, can skew basic and won’t automatically win design awards without some human polish. At the moment, it’s English‑only. The practical workaround is to treat Stitch as the accelerator for structure and coverage, then refine the visuals and micro‑interactions in Figma, and validate the exported HTML and CSS in your stack.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? For zero dollars, Stitch delivers rapid, editable app and website interfaces powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro, complete with code and Figma export, plus a Canvas view to manage flows. The value is exceptional if you need speed for prototypes, client proposals, or version‑one builds, and it can translate directly into revenue by shortening sales cycles and delivery timelines. If you require multilingual support, heavily bespoke art direction, or award‑level craft, plan to layer in design time after export. But at a price of free, the cost‑benefit skews heavily in favor of using Stitch now for fast starts and then refining as needed.",
