      "summary": "You need boredom in your life. Without it, your brain misses the chance to do the slow, wandering work that creates meaning, and the result is more anxiety, more depression, and a nagging sense of hollowness. The key idea is simple: when you’re not occupied, your brain’s “default mode network” switches on, and that uncomfortable quiet is exactly where purpose and insight begin.\n\nFirst, let’s look at what boredom actually does in the brain. The default mode network is a set of regions that light up when you have nothing specific to focus on—like when you’re sitting at a red light without your phone. In that state, your mind drifts to big, sometimes uneasy questions: What does my life mean? Am I on the right path? It’s not always pleasant, but it’s essential for building coherence and significance.\n\nNow, here’s the twist: we hate that feeling so much we’ll do almost anything to avoid it. In a classic experiment, people were told to sit quietly for 15 minutes with nothing to do, except push a button that delivered a painful electric shock. A majority chose to shock themselves rather than sit with their thoughts. That reflex to escape boredom is powerful, and today, it has a near-perfect outlet.\n\nMoving on to the modern problem, constant stimulation—especially from the phone in your pocket—lets you shut off boredom instantly. Standing at a crosswalk for 15 seconds? Out comes the screen. Over time, that habit suppresses the default mode network, which means fewer chances to wrestle with meaning. That creates a doom loop: the less you pause, the less meaning you find; the less meaning you feel, the more you reach for quick hits of distraction. It’s a recipe for more anxiety and more depression.\n\nSo what should you do? Start training your tolerance for boredom like a muscle. Tomorrow’s workout, go without your phone—no podcast, no music—just your thoughts and your breathing. Expect your most interesting ideas to show up when there’s nothing to drown them out. On your commute, try silence, not even the radio. Aim for stretches of 15 minutes or longer, and let your mind wander. As you build this capacity, ordinary life gets richer. You’ll feel less bored at work, more present in your relationships, and more willing to engage the big questions.\n\nWhen it comes to practical boundaries, simple protocols make a huge difference. Set a no-device cutoff in the evening—say, after 7:00 p.m. Don’t sleep with your phone in the bedroom. Keep meals device-free so your attention belongs to the people who are actually there. And schedule regular social media or screen fasts. At first it feels like withdrawal—your dopamine system will scream, get the phone—but that noise settles, and you come out calmer and clearer.\n\nHowever, there’s a common fear: what if you miss something important? Use your phone’s settings so only one or two emergency contacts can break through. Everything else can wait. Twitter is not an emergency. The news can wait. Your grandparents didn’t track Washington minute by minute, and they got by just fine. Don’t let manufactured urgency hijack your peace.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? You need boredom because it switches on the part of your brain that knits life into meaning. Protect device-free time, tolerate the initial discomfort, and give your mind space to roam. Build boredom into workouts, commutes, evenings, and meals, and run periodic social media cleanses. The payoff is more ideas, more clarity, deeper purpose—and a real shot at feeling happier. Put the phone down. Your meaning is waiting in the quiet.",
