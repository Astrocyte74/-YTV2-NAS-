# Data Directory

Runtime artifacts generated by the NAS pipeline. This folder is ignored by Git except for this README.

- `reports/` – JSON reports produced after each video is processed. Optional/local debugging/backfill only; dashboard reads Postgres.
- `transcripts/` – Cached transcript payloads for debugging and reprocessing.
- `backups/` – Any ad-hoc database or report snapshots kept for disaster recovery.
- `logs/` – Historical maintenance logs (backfill, cleanup, metadata fixes). New logs should land here automatically.
- `ledger.json`, `ytv2_content.db` – Local runtime state; both are ignored from version control.

Old SQLite migration artefacts have been removed (e.g., `process_locks.db`, `reports_pre_repalced/`).
